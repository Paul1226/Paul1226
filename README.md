## Projects üõ†
Among the exercises and projects provided by the conquerblock Academy, which is the institution where I am training, are:
- Layout exercises for web page headers
- Layout exercises for landing pages
- Responsive web pages

Within the Udemy training courses there are many more central exercises in the development of web pages, exercises focused more on JavaScript.üñ•

I will upload all these mini projects to my profile hoping that you will help me with your contributions and in the same way I will make modifications to make them professional projects.üë©‚Äçüíª
